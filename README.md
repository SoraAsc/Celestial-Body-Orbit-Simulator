# Celestial Body Orbit Simulator

## Overview

This project is a physics-based simulation of celestial bodies, modeling their motion and interaction using gravitational forces. Users can customize the simulation parameters, such as integration methods (Euler, RK4), time steps, and celestial body properties, to explore different dynamics. The simulation leverages a JSON configuration file for easy adjustment of parameters and bodies.

## Features

- **Multiple Integration Methods:** Choose between Euler or RK4 for numerical integration.

- **Flexible Configuration:** Configure simulation parameters and celestial bodies through a JSON file.
